# PuzzleNode Solutions

My solutions in Ruby to the first 12 [PuzzleNode programming challenges](http://www.puzzlenode.com/). I'm currently on the [leaderboard](http://www.puzzlenode.com/leaderboard) (look for Steve Morris).

## Hints

To efficiently solve many of these challenges, you'll need to be comfortable with both recursion and graph theory. I found [this article](http://www.python.org/doc/essays/graphs) extremely helpful for implementing graphs (translating the Python code to Ruby was straightforward).

## Requirements

Ruby 1.9.2

Gems required by one or more solutions:

* RSpec (`gem install rspec`)
* Nokogiri (`gem install nokogiri`)
